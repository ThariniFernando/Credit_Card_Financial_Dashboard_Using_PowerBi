Credit Card Financial Dashboard - End-to-End Power BI Project

This project demonstrates the development of an end-to-end Power BI solution using a PostgreSQL database. The solution includes two interactive dashboards:

Credit Card Transaction Report:
Provides insights into transaction trends, volumes, and patterns.
Visualizes key metrics to monitor financial performance.

Credit Card Customer Report:
Focuses on customer data, highlighting spending behavior, demographics, and credit usage.
The dashboards are connected to a PostgreSQL database via Power BI, enabling real-time updates on a weekly basis. DAX queries are utilized for dynamic calculations and data transformation. This project showcases how to integrate SQL databases with Power BI for real-world financial analysis applications.
